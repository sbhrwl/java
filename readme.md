## Programming language
- Machine Level Language: 
  - Low-level programming languages includes machine language.
  - It is also known as object code or machine code. 
  - Machine language is typically displayed in binary or hexahecimal form (base 16) form. 
  - Since computers can read machine language programmes directly, there is no need for a translator to convert the programmes.
  - Machine language has **executes code quickly** compared to high-level programming languages.
- Assembly language: 
  - Another form of low-level programming language created for certain processors is assembly language (ASM). 
  - It gives the collection of directions in a symbolic and clear manner for humans to understand. 
  - An assembler is used to translate assembly language into machine language.
  - Assembly language has the benefit of **requiring less memory and less time to execute a program**.
- High-level languages: 
  - The high-level programming language (HLL) is made for creating user-friendly web pages and software applications. 
  - The program must be converted into machine code using a **compiler or interpreter** when using this programming language.
  - A high-level language's main benefit is that it is **simple to read, write, and maintain**.
  - Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, anh Swift are examples of high-level proframming languages.

## Introduction to Java
- Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, and it was released in 1995h
- James Gosling initially developed Java in Sun Microsystems (which was later merged with Oracle Corporation)
- Java is a set of features of C and C++. It has obtained its format from C, and OOP features from C++
- Java programs are platform independent which means they can be run on any operating system with any processor as long as the Java interpreter is available on that system
- Java code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another platformi it's called **write once, run anywhere** (WORA)
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java code, but it has been written in platform-specific languages such as C/C++/ASM, etc. 
- Java interpreter is a part of JVM

## Features of Java
- Object-Oriented - The features of object-oriented programming are supported by Java. Its object model is straight forward and flexible
- Platform independent - Because Java and C++ are platform independent, application programs created in one Operating system can run on any other Operating system. C and C++, however, are platform dependent languages, making it impossible for application programs created in one Operating system to run in any other Operating system
- Simple - Because Java incorporates many C/C++ capabilities, it is simple to understand
- Secure - Java offers a variety of defences against malware and viruses. It guarantees that neither damage nor security will be compromised
- Portable - We have the idea of portability in Java. Java allows the same software to run on various platforms
- Robust - It assists us in identifying potential errors as soon as feasible during program development
- Multi-threaded - Java's multithreading programming capability enables you to create a program that executes multiple tasks concurrently
- Distributed -Java maintains the TCP/IP protocol and is therefore suitable for distributed Internet environments.
