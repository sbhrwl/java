## Programming language
- Machine Level Language: 
  - Low-level programming languages includes machine language.
  - It is also known as object code or machine code. 
  - Machine language is typically displayed in binary or hexahecimal form (base 16) form. 
  - Since computers can read machine language programmes directly, there is no need for a translator to convert the programmes.
  - Machine language has **executes code quickly** compared to high-level programming languages.
- Assembly language: 
  - Another form of low-level programming language created for certain processors is assembly language (ASM). 
  - It gives the collection of directions in a symbolic and clear manner for humans to understand. 
  - An assembler is used to translate assembly language into machine language.
  - Assembly language has the benefit of **requiring less memory and less time to execute a program**.
- High-level languages: 
  - The high-level programming language (HLL) is made for creating user-friendly web pages and software applications. 
  - The program must be converted into machine code using a **compiler or interpreter** when using this programming language.
  - A high-level language's main benefit is that it is **simple to read, write, and maintain**.
  - Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, anh Swift are examples of high-level proframming languages.

## Introduction to Java
- Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, and it was released in 1995h
- James Gosling initially developed Java in Sun Microsystems (which was later merged with Oracle Corporation)
- Java is a set of features of C and C++. It has obtained its format from C, and OOP features from C++
- Java programs are platform independent which means they can be run on any operating system with any processor as long as the Java interpreter is available on that system
- Java code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another platformi it's called **write once, run anywhere** (WORA)
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java code, but it has been written in platform-specific languages such as C/C++/ASM, etc. 
- Java interpreter is a part of JVM

## Features of Java
- Object-Oriented - The features of object-oriented programming are supported by Java. Its object model is straight forward and flexible
- Platform independent - Because Java and C++ are platform independent, application programs created in one Operating system can run on any other Operating system. C and C++, however, are platform dependent languages, making it impossible for application programs created in one Operating system to run in any other Operating system
- Simple - Because Java incorporates many C/C++ capabilities, it is simple to understand
- Secure - Java offers a variety of defences against malware and viruses. It guarantees that neither damage nor security will be compromised
- Portable - We have the idea of portability in Java. Java allows the same software to run on various platforms
- Robust - It assists us in identifying potential errors as soon as feasible during program development
- Multi-threaded - Java's multithreading programming capability enables you to create a program that executes multiple tasks concurrently
- Distributed -Java maintains the TCP/IP protocol and is therefore suitable for distributed Internet environments.

## Platform independency
- Platform = OS + Processor (Windows + Intel)
- Java program (`.java` file) -> Compiler -> **Bytecode** (`.class` file) -> JVM converts it to MLL and executes
- Same bytecode can be also be executed on other platforms (JVM knows how to do it) (32.7:00)
- So Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA)

## Classes and Objects
- An object is an entity with `state` (properties) and `behaviour` (methods), such as a chair, bike, marker, pen, table, or car. It could be intellectual or physical (tangible and intangible).
  - The banking system is an illustration of an intangible entity.
- An object has three characteristics
  - State: represents an object's data (value)
  - Behavior: represents how an object behaves (or how it functions), such as when you deposit or withdraw money
  - Identity: Usually, a distinct ID is used to implement an object's identification. The external user cannot see the value of the ID. However, the JVM uses it internally to uniquely identify each object.
- Pen, for instance, is an object. Reynolds is its name; its state is noted as being white. Writing is its behaviour because it is utilized for writing.
- Different ways of Object Definition
  - An object is a real-world entity
  - An object is a runtime entity
  - The object is an entity which has state and behaviour
  - The object is an instance of a class.
- A **class serves as a model or blueprint from which new objects can be made**.
- Therefore, a class's instance (or result) is an object.
- A class includes
  - Fields
  - Methods
  - Constructors
  - Blocks
  - Nested class and interface

## Main method
`public static void main(String args[])`
- The main () is the starting point for JVM to start execution of a Java program. 
- Without the main () method, JVM will not execute the program. 
- The syntax of the main () method is: 
  - public: An access specifier. 
    - So before calling the main() method, we need to use the public keyword to **let the JVM know where the programme is actually being executed**. 
    - Before the main() method, if we use private, protected, and default, the JVM won't be able to see it.
  - static: You can make a method static by using the keyword static. 
    - We should call the main() method **without creating an object**. 
    - Static methods are the method which are invoked without creating the objects.
  - void: In Java, every method has the return type. 
    - Void keyword acknowledges the compiler that the main() method does not return any value.
  - main(): It is a default signature which is **predefined in the JVM**. 
    - It is called by JVM to execute a program line by line and end the execution after completion of this method. 
    - We can also overload the main() method.
  - String args[]: The main() method also accepts some data from the user. 
    - It accepts a group of strings, which is called a string array. 
    - It is used to hold the command line arguments in the form of string values.
    - Here, agrs[] is the array name, and it is of String type. 
    - It means that it can store a group of strings. 
    - Remember, this array can also store a group of numbers but in the form of string only. 
    - Values passed to the main() method are called arguments. 
    - These arguments are stored into an args[] array, so the name args[] is generally used for it.
- Other ways of writing main method
```
public static void main(String args[])
public static void main(String []args)
static public void main(String args[])
static public void main(String ... args)
```
