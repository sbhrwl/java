### [Oops fundamentals
- [Object creation](lectures/1.ObjectCreation.pdf)
- [Instance variable vs local variables](lectures/2.Instance-Localvariables)
- Methods with memory maps (JVM data areas)
  - Class level binary data including static variables will be stored in method area
  - Objects and corresponding instance variables will be stored in the Heap area. For every method the JVM will create a Runtime stack, all method calls performed by that Thread and corresponding local variables will be stored in that stack. Every entry in stack is called Stack Frame or Action Record
  - The instruction which has to execute next will be stored in the corresponding PC Registers.
  - Native method invocations will be stored in native method stacks.
