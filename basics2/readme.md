### Oops fundamentals
- [Object creation](lectures/1.ObjectCreation.pdf), [exercise](exercises/ObjectCreation.java)
- [Instance variable vs local variables](lectures/2.Instance-Localvariables.pdf)
- Methods with memory maps (JVM data areas)
<img src="lectures/jvm_memory_areas.jpg"> 
  
  - Class level binary data including static variables will be stored in `method area`
  - Objects and corresponding instance variables will be stored in the `Heap area`. 
    - For every method the JVM will create a `Runtime stack`, 
    - All method calls performed by that Thread and corresponding local variables will be stored in that stack. 
    - Every entry in stack is called Stack Frame or Action Record
  - The instruction which has to execute next will be stored in the corresponding `PC Registers`.
  - Native method invocations will be stored in `native method stacks`. 
- [Method overloading](lectures/3.MethodOverloading-AutomaticePromotion.pdf), [exercise](exercises/MethodOverloading.java)
